# Sihal
Sihal is a program to update Microsoft Server Compact 4.0 databases. You can define XML-Files for versioning your database.
In the XML-File you declare the sql and version of the database model. If a declaration is executed, the sql isn't executed anymore.
Sihal adds an own table to your database model to recognize the declarations.
